Mind Your Mana is a dungeon crawler where you draw different symbols to cast spells.

Mind Your Mana is the winner of the [HackSussex 2025 GameJam](https://hacksussex-gamejam-2025.devpost.com/project-gallery)!

It is inspired by the Minecraft [Hex Casting Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/hex-casting/versions) and the [2016 Halloween Google Doodle](https://doodles.google/doodle/halloween-2016/). The artstyle is inspired by retro games such as A Link to the Past.
